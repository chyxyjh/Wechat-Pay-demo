# Wechat-Pay-demo
a demo based on React.js to simulate Wechat Pay UI

In this demo,I use some React components to complete this page.
And in order to achieve the page switch,I use props to to achieve communication between components.

Pay in Wechat around us is very common now. Since I started to learn React I have thought to do a demo for practice. I create the idea to simulate this page in shop. So it happened.
This is a novice's small attempt while learning React.js, the coding level of mine also need to improve, please forgive me:)
